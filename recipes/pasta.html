    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Bolognese sauce is basically a sauce made with ground beef, onions,
      tomatoes and fresh herbs, and served with pasta. It’s an Italian meat
      sauce that originated from the city of Bologna. However, it’s more than
      just beef, onions and a jar of spaghetti sauce. It’s about the depth of
      flavor you get from cooking all the ingredients in stages and letting the
      sauce simmer so it becomes thick, rich and hearty.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 medium yellow onions, peeled and chopped into 1-inch chunks</li>
      <li>2 carrots, peeled and chopped into 1-inch chunks</li>
      <li>2 celery stalks, cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, very roughly chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1⅓ pounds ground beef (85% lean)</li>
      <li>4 ounces pancetta, finely diced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt (plus more for pasta water)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>½ cup dry red wine</li>
      <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
      <li>1 (14-oz) can crushed tomatoes (about 1¾ cups)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>1 pound pasta</li>
      <li>Handful chopped fresh basil or parsley, for serving (optional)</li>
      <li>Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, for serving (optional)</li>
      <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place the onions in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal
          blade. Pulse until very finely chopped but not puréed. Transfer the
          onions to a separate bowl, then add the carrots, celery, and garlic to
          the food processor. Pulse until finely chopped.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
          Add the finely chopped onions and vegetable mixture and cook, stirring
          frequently, until soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Lower the heat if the
          vegetables start to brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the ground beef, pancetta, salt, and pepper and cook over
          medium-high heat, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until the
          meat is no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the wine and cook until it is almost dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the broth, crushed tomatoes and oregano. Bring to a gentle boil,
          then reduce heat to low. Cover with the lid slightly ajar and simmer
          for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the milk to the sauce and stir to combine. Cover with the lid
          slightly ajar and simmer until the milk is absorbed and the meat is
          tender, about 35 minutes. If the sauce looks greasy, use a soup spoon
          to skim the fat off of the top. Remove the pan from the heat and cover
          to keep warm while you make the pasta.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according
          to package instructions. Before straining, ladle out 1 cup of the
          pasta water into a bowl or measuring cup and set aside. Drain the
          pasta, then add to the sauce. Toss with tongs, adding the reserved
          pasta water little by little if the pasta seems dry. Taste and adjust
          seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary. Divide the pasta into
          serving bowls and sprinkle with fresh herbs, if using. Pass the grated
          Parmigiano Reggiano at the table.
